The top row consists of feature labels, which are info about each mutation. This information includes:
-NCBI_Build
-Chromosome#
-Start_position
-End_position
-Hugo_Symbol
-Variant_class
-Variant_type
-reference_allele
-Tumor_seq_allele_1
-Tumor_seq_allele_2

before adding a feature, the mutation is also checked to make sure it is somatic (?)
