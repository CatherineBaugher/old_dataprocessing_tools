feature filtering is a must, because there are nearly 70,000 features

the method of doing this is by calculating the top accuracy as well as top information gain and finding the union of these two sets

this union is the final filtered set, and to be used with analysis




union of info gain (1%) and accuracy (1%):

-----------------------------------------------

accuracy1 features: 889

infogain1 features: 889

union features: 1339




union of info gain (.5%) and accuracy (.5%):

-----------------------------------------------

accuracy1 features: 445

infogain1 features: 445

union features: 888
